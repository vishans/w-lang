        .text-box-title The meta clause
        .text-box-content. 
            The #[code meta:] clause is, as its name suggests for #[strong meta data].
            For example if you want to save your workouts as a .csv file, you need to include the csv flag in the #[code meta:] clause.
            #[br] 
            #[br] 

            Below is the exhaustive list of the default available attributes in the #[code meta:] clause

            If you are wondering, how some attributes like #[code exercise-execution], 
            #[code type], #[code resistance-type], #[code rep-duration]... have a value even though their values have not been explicitly given, this is because, these attributes have default values. Just like the #[code meta:] clause has a file where attributes' default values and data types can be specified, the #[code set] clause has one too and so does the #[code workout] clause. We'll look at them later on.
